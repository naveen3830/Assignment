It executes commands in a step-by-step manner, just like a series of verbal commands.\n# ii)The functional programming paradigm treats program computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions based on lambda calculus.\n# iii)The procedural programming paradigm is a subtype of imperative programming in which statements are structured into procedures.\n# iv)The object-oriented programming paradigm considers basic entities as objects whose instance can contain both data and the corresponding methods to modify that data.
